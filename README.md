in continuous seismic data.

For details on the analysis method, please read (and cite): Roman, D.C. (2017), Automated detection and characterization of harmonic tremor in continuous seismic data. Geophys. Res. Lett., 44, doi: 10.1002/2017GL073715.

PLEASE NOTE: Requires Matlab R2013b or later including the Matlab Signal Processing and Stats Toolboxes.

Report bugs or suggestions for future releases to droman@carnegiescience.edu. 


NECESSARY FILES - The working directory must contain three files: 
1. tremometer_control.m
2. tremometer.m
3. A single-column ascii file containing one day of seismic data. Note: Tremometer does not provide filtering or instrument response deconvolution, so these operations should be peformed independently before analysis. For this task I recommend using the code described in Haney et al. (2012) Causal Instrument Corrections for Short Period and Broadband Seismometers. Seismological Research Letters 83, 834-845.


SETUP
The user should set seven parameters in the first section of 'tremometer_control.m': 

The first five parameters describe the seismic data to be analyzed: 
1. x - Assign one day of (instrument-corrected and filtered) data to x
2. yr - Set start date (four digit year) of input data
3. mo - Set start date (two digit month) of input data
4. dy - Set start date (two digit day) of input data
5. fs - Set sampling frequency (in Hz). 

The next two parameters describe the criteria for detection of harmonic tremor: 

6. minfreq - set the minimum allowed frequency of the fundamental (in Hz). Default is 0.5 Hz
7. minHSI - set the minimum allowed Harmonic Strength Index for the fundamental and first two overtones. Default is 30. 

The final parameter toggles whether a periodogram is displayed for each detected minute of tremor. 

8. calmodeflag - Toggle periodogram plots on (1) or off (0). Default is on (1). 

OPERATION
Once the control parameters have been set, execute the code by running tremometer_control.m at the Matlab command line (from the working directory)
> tremometer_control


EXAMPLE
An example of one day of instrument-corrected, bandpass-filtered (0.5-20Hz) seismic data containing multiple episodes of harmonic tremor is provided as 'example.asc'. To run as an example, download this file and unzip it, place it in a directory with tremometer_control.m and tremometer.m, edit tremometer_control.m to set fs=40 and x=example.asc, and run tremometer_control.m at the Matlab command line. You can also adjust parameters 6 and 7 to see the effect on the number of detections. 


OUTPUT
By default the code outputs the following information at the end of each run: 
1. A command window list of each tremor detection (detection time, frequencies of the fundamental and first three harmonics, and HSI for the fundamental and first two harmonics). This information is also contained in the workspace in the 'detections' table. 

2. The variable 'final' contains the analysis results for all input data. Each row corresponds to a minute of the analyzed day of data (1440 rows). 

3. (Calibration mode) A figure will be displayed for each identified minute of harmonic tremor, showing the periodigram and detected fundamental and harmonics (three '*' symbols). 

4. Figure 1: The HSI of the fundamental for the entire day. 

5. Figure 2: The frequencies and time(s) for each identified minute of harmonic tremor. 


TO BE ADDED TO FUTURE VERSIONS
1. An option to adjust the analysis increment (currently hardwired as one minute). This will help in detection of short episodes of strongly gliding tremor. 

2. Advanced options to check a variable number of harmonics, allow different HSI detection thresholds for each harmonic, set the number of consecutive minutes of tremor required for a detection. 

3. More/better plotting options

4. Reduction of toolbox dependencies. 

KNOWN BUGS (to be fixed in future versions): 
It still (rarely) throws 'Index exceeds matrix dimensions' errors. Sometimes because data is not one full day. Add a workaround for this.
